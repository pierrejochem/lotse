# Lotse

Lotse is a message broker in Rust: reliable queues and persistent streams on one replicated log, with exactly-once delivery.

Status: foundation. The runtime seam, the record format, the segmented log and the simulation harness exist and are tested, and so does the management console, which runs against a built-in demo cluster. Raft, transactions, queue and stream semantics and the broker server come next.

## Crates

| Crate | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `lotse-rt` | The only seam to the outside world: `Clock`, `Disk`, `SegmentFile`, `Spawn`, `Rng` as traits |
| `lotse-record` | The batch format used on disk, on the wire and in Raft: 65-byte header, ZigZag-varint records, CRC32C, transaction markers |
| `lotse-log` | Segmented partition log (also the Raft log): append, read, roll, truncate, crash recovery |
| `lotse-sim` | Deterministic simulation: seeded executor with virtual time, a disk that loses unsynced data and tears writes on crash |
| `lotse-console` | Management console for a dedicated node: serves the web app, REST/JSON (OpenAPI) and one WebSocket for live updates |

## Management console

`lotse-console` is one binary. It embeds the React app from `console/web` and talks to the clusters on behalf of the signed-in user. Until `lotse-client` exists it serves a **demo cluster** with sample data that moves over time.

```sh
cd console/web && npm ci && npm run build && cd ../..      # build the web app first
cargo run -p lotse-console -- --config console/lotse-console.example.toml
# open http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

For frontend work, run `npm run dev` in `console/web` next to a running `lotse-console`; Vite proxies `/api` and the WebSocket to port 8080. After changing an API type in Rust, run `npm run api` to regenerate `openapi.json` and the TypeScript client; CI fails if they drift.

Frontend stack: React 18, TypeScript, Radix primitives, React Router, TanStack Query with `openapi-fetch`. Styles use the Lotse tokens, light and dark.

Everything above `lotse-rt` is written against its traits, never against Tokio or `std::time` directly. `clippy.toml` enforces that, and also bans `HashMap`/`HashSet`, whose iteration order would make simulation runs unrepeatable.

## Testing

```sh
cargo test --workspace
```

The crash test in `crates/lotse-sim/tests/log_crash.rs` appends, syncs, truncates and pulls the plug across hundreds of seeded runs, then checks that every synced batch survives and nothing is invented. To run more seeds, or reproduce a failure:

```sh
LOTSE_SIM_SEEDS=5000 cargo test -p lotse-sim --release   # many seeds
LOTSE_SIM_SEED=1234 cargo test -p lotse-sim               # one seed, exactly
```

A failing run prints the seed that reproduces it.

## Known gaps

- Compression codecs (zstd, lz4) are declared in the format but not implemented; compressed batches are rejected.
- The sparse offset index is rebuilt by scanning on open; `.index`, `.timeindex` and `.txnindex` files come later.
- `Net` joins `lotse-rt` together with `lotse-server`.
- There is no Tokio implementation of `lotse-rt` yet; it lands with `lotse-broker`.
- Console: only the demo cluster exists (`kind = "native"` is refused until `lotse-client` lands), and sign-in is `dev` mode only (OIDC is refused at startup). Purge, requeue and moving leaders have no API yet, so the UI does not offer them. On a phone the navigation sits above the page instead of collapsing into a menu.
